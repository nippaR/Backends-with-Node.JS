The web app, KindBite, is a platform designed to reduce food waste and combat food insecurity. It connects restaurants or food donors (such as supermarkets, event organizers) with volunteers and communities in need. The app allows donors to list surplus food, volunteers to facilitate logistics, and recipients to access the donated food.
